Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem in Python Using Particle Swarm Optimization
===================
*Made as the final project of the course "Técnicas de optimización at Universidad de Antioquia", in the first semester of 2024.*

*This was forked and adapted to fit our needs, check above to see the original repository.*

Source code for the PSO implementation is stored in `pso.py` and some utilities in `util.py`, while the main execution and comparison of the homework is done in the IPython notebook.
The notebook can also be accessed using [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xc9W6GYYreXln-AIk6EIF3LtEvkqshqn/view?usp=sharing).

***WARNING:*** The notebook has a really long loop for the best parameter search, it is disabled by default by a flag named `already_done`, if you want to execute the loop, set this flag to `False`.
